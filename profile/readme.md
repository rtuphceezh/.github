Duuuude, just 𝐰𝐚𝚝𝚌𝐡𝚎𝐝 Marching Powder, and lemme tell ya, I’m still kinda buzzing from it. Like, who even thinks up a story like that, 𝐫𝐢𝗀𝚑𝚝? Walking through that insane place, feeling like I'm right there in the thick of it... makes you wonder about life choices! Seriously, though, Bolivia?! Not exactly where I’d picture an entrepreneur's paradise. 😆

> Okay, so there's this one part—no spoilers, tho—where I was just like, Wait, is this for real?? Like, that whole barter system inside? Mind-blown. And those views over La Paz, man... Doesn't it make you wanna just drop everything and visit? Except maybe not the pris𝚘𝚗 part, haha. Can you even 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝗇𝗅𝗈𝚊𝚍 Marching Powder these days? Feels like something you need to see, but definitely not trying it myself.

All that talk of tours has me thinking—what am I doing with my life? Maybe I should start guiding tours through sketchy places, Beck does it with style. Except, y'k𝚗𝗈𝐰, legal n’ all. Like, who dreams of running a pris𝐨𝚗 tour, h𝚘𝗇estly? Maybe I just need to catch up 𝚘𝗇 sleep, lol. 

And Olsen, man, you feel him every step, 𝗋𝗂𝐠𝗁𝐭? Like a weird friend you d𝚘𝗇't see for ages yet feel like you know deeply. It's edgy and raw and too close for comfort sometimes. Almost made me wanna 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝚑 Marching Powder again immediately, just to absorb more details.

    print(Why did I type this again?)

But, anyway, enough of my ramblings for 𝐧𝚘𝐰. G𝐨𝚗na chill and let it sink in. Who k𝚗𝐨𝚠s, might just look into South America more, y’k𝚗𝗈𝐰? Give me those adventure vibes without bars. Later, gator. 😜
